This is a game demo of a 2D roguelike concept I'm working on. 
<br>
This game was born in April 2023 for a GameJam, but for a lack of time I wasn't able to deliver that. Right now i want to complete the concept, implementing its core mechanics.
<br>
The concept of the game is to charge 4 ritual altar, located in the 4 boundaries of the map. Every time an altar is charged, the player can take control of some mobs and use them as an army.
After the 4 altar are fully charged, the player has to fight against a boss (WIP)
